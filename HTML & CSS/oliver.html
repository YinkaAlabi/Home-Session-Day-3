			Oliver's friend Dick tells him that he will be well and happy after he is dead because he dreams of heaven, angels and kind faces that he never sees when he is awake. Dick later tells Bumble that he is happy to die young so he can be a child with his little sister, who is already in heaven.

			When Rose gets sick, Mrs. Maylie tells Oliver that heaven is brighter than this world and the passage to it is speedy. She asks that God's will be done and says that God knows how much she loves Rose. Oliver prays to heaven on several occasions. Right before Nancy is killed, she prays to her Maker for mercy.

			Harry, Rose's suitor, gives up his political ambitions and becomes a clergyman. At the end of the novel, the narrator gives thanks to that Being whose code is mercy and whose great attribute is benevolence, saying that without Him, happiness can never be attained.
